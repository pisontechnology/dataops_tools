The following DataOps tools live in this repo:
  1. Pantheon Protocol Generator
  2. Vulcan Protocol Generator


# Pantheon Protocol generator
This tool takes a csv and creates a json file that can then be pushed via the Pantheon protocol CLI: https://github.com/pisontechnology/pantheon

There are two csv files that provide examples of how the csv should be formatted for different types of protocols 

# Vulcan Protocol Generator
This tool takes a csv and creates a json file that can be shared with NEOHUB once downloaded on a phone. It supported multiple json versions of the app.

There is also an example csv file that can be reformatted to suit the needs of a new protocol.
